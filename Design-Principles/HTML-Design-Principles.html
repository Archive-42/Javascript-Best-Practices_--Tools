    <h2 class="mume-header" id="1-compatibility">1. Compatibility</h2>

    <p>There are many ways of interpreting compatibility. Sometimes the terms &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; and
      &quot;forwards compatibility&quot; are used, but sometimes the meaning of those terms can be unclear. The
      principles in this section address different facets of compatibility.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="support-existing-content">Support Existing Content</h3>

    <p>This principle applies primarily to the supported language.</p>
    <p>Existing content often relies upon expected user agent processing and behavior to function as intended.
      Processing requirements should be specified to ensure that user agents implementing this specification will be
      able to handle most existing content. In particular, it should be possible to process existing HTML documents as
      HTML&#xA0;5 and get results that are compatible with the existing expectations of users and authors, based on the
      behavior of existing browsers. It should be made possible, though not necessarily required, to do this without
      mode switching.</p>
    <p>Content relying on existing browser behavior can take many forms. It may rely on elements, attributes or APIs
      that are part of earlier HTML specifications, but not part of HTML&#xA0;5, or on features that are entirely
      proprietary. It may depend on specific error handling rules. In rare cases, it may depend on a feature from
      earlier HTML specifications <em>not</em> being implemented as specified.</p>
    <p>When considering changes to legacy features or behavior, relative to current implementations and author
      expectations, the following questions should be considered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does a significant quantity of existing content depend on the feature or behavior?</li>
      <li>Does any of the dependent content occur on particularly popular websites?</li>
      <li>Is the dependent content genuinely intended for consumption, rather than occurring solely in test cases or
        examples?</li>
      <li>Is the dependent content on the public web, rather than found solely on internal sites with a controlled user
        environment?</li>
      <li>Does the dependent content currently work as intended in multiple popular user agents, rather than explicitly
        targeting only one particular user agent, or only very old or otherwise unpopular ones?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The benefit of the proposed change should be weighed against the likely cost of breaking content, as measured by
      these criteria. In some cases, it may be desirable to make a nonstandard feature or behavior part of the
      conforming language, if it satisfies a valid use case. However, the fact that something is part of the supported
      language does not by itself mean that relying on it is condoned or encouraged.</p>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Examples</strong></em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many sites use broken markup, such as badly nested elements
      (<strong> <code class="language-javascript">\&lt;b&gt;a\&lt;i&gt;b\&lt;/b&gt;c\&lt;/i&gt;</code></strong>), and both authors and users have
      expectations based on the error handling used by legacy user agents. We need to define processing requirements
      that remain compatible with the expected handling of such content.</p>
    <p>Some sites rely on the <strong> <code class="language-javascript">\&lt;u&gt;</code></strong> element giving the presentational effect of an
      underline.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="degrade-gracefully">Degrade Gracefully</h3>

    <hr>
    <p>This guideline applies fundamentally to the adjusting language.</p>
    <p>On the World Wide Web, creators are regularly hesitant to utilize new dialect includes that mess up more seasoned
      client specialists, or that don&apos;t give a type of elegant fallback. HTML&#xA0;5 report conformance
      prerequisites should be planned so that Web substance can debase nimbly in more established or less fit client
      specialists, in any event, when utilizing new components, traits, APIs and substance models.</p>
    <p>It isn&apos;t really suitable to consider each Web client specialist ever constructed, including even old
      variants of programs or apparatuses that are amazingly disagreeable even in their specialty markets. Nonetheless,
      solid thought should be given to the accompanying classes of client specialists. All things considered, content
      creators will think that its imperative to focus on these classifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Current forms of the top standard Web programs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Highly well known more established renditions of standard Web programs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The top client specialists intended to address explicit issues or address specific business sectors, for
          example, assistive innovations, versatile programs or client specialists focusing on less commonplace media,
          for example, text-just terminals or print.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes, another component may just not matter to a specific class of client specialists, or might be
      unfeasible to plan in a manner that can corrupt. For instance, new scripting APIs can&apos;t be made to work in
      scriptless client specialists. Be that as it may, as a rule, approaches like the accompanying can be utilized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>another component or quality may give extra semantics without losing basic usefulness when not comprehended.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another scripting technique or trait can be tried before use in content utilizing ECMAScript reflection
          offices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component or characteristic may give semantics and a straightforward default delivering that can be
          accomplished utilizing CSS, so expansion of a little template permits smooth corruption.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component, characteristic or scripting API may have conduct that can be imitated using extra content,
          despite the fact that the scripted methodology may not give a similar degree of execution and comfort.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component may require a profoundly particular delivering, however permit diverse substance to be
          given as fallback to client specialists that don&apos;t comprehend the component.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em><strong>Examples</strong></em></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The default introduction of the proposed &apos;insignificant&apos; trait can be copied through the CSS rule
      &apos;[irrelevant] { show: none; }&apos;.</p>
    <p>Proposed new sight and sound components like &apos;&lt;canvas&gt; fallback &lt;/canvas&gt;&apos; or
      &apos;&lt;video&gt; fallback &lt;/video&gt;&apos; permit fallback content. More established client specialists
      will show &quot;fallback&quot; while client specialists supporting &apos;canvas&apos; or &apos;video&apos; will
      show the interactive media content.</p>
    <p>The proposed &apos;getElementsByClassName()&apos; strategy can be made extensively quicker than unadulterated
      ECMAScript usage found in existing libraries, however a content based execution can be utilized when the local
      form isn&apos;t accessible.</p>
    <p>The &apos;&lt;datalist&gt;&apos; component can be related with an &apos;&lt;input&gt;&apos; component and may
      contain a covered up &apos;&lt;select&gt;&apos; component. This way the fallback for the proposed &quot;combo
      box&quot; control can be a content field or a book field with a related spring up menu in existing standard
      programs</p>
    <p>Now and again, another component may essentially not make a difference to a specific class of client specialists,
      or might be unfeasible to plan in a manner that can debase. For instance, new scripting APIs can&apos;t be made to
      work in scriptless client specialists. Be that as it may, as a rule, approaches like the accompanying can be
      utilized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>another component or quality may give extra semantics without losing fundamental usefulness when not
          comprehended.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another scripting strategy or property can be tried before use in content utilizing ECMAScript reflection
          offices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component or property may give semantics and a basic default delivering that can be accomplished
          utilizing CSS, so expansion of a little template permits effortless corruption.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component, quality or scripting Programming interface may have conduct that can be imitated using
          extra content, in spite of the fact that the scripted methodology may not give a similar degree of execution
          and accommodation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>another component may require a profoundly specific delivering, however permit distinctive substance to be
          given as fallback to client specialists that don&apos;t comprehend the component.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This rundown isn&apos;t thorough; now and again marginally more muddled methodologies are more viable.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="do-not-reinvent-the-wheel">Do not Reinvent the Wheel</h3>

    <p>If there is already a widely used and implemented technology covering particular use cases, consider specifying
      that technology in preference to inventing something new for the same purpose. Sometimes, though, new use cases
      may call for a new approach instead of more extensions on an old approach.</p>
    <p><strong> <code class="language-javascript">contenteditable=&quot;&quot;</code></strong> was already used and implemented by user agents. No
      need to invent a new feature.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="pave-the-cowpaths">Pave the Cowpaths</h3>

    <p>When a practice is already widespread among authors, consider adopting it rather than forbidding it or inventing
      something new.</p>
    <p>Authors already use the <strong> <code class="language-javascript">\&lt;br/&gt;</code></strong> syntax as opposed to
      <strong> <code class="language-javascript">\&lt;br&gt;</code></strong> in HTML and there is no harm done by allowing that to be used.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="evolution-not-revolution">Evolution Not Revolution</h3>

    <p>Revolutions sometimes change the world to the better. Most often, however, it is better to evolve an existing
      design rather than throwing it away. This way, authors don&apos;t have to learn new models and content will live
      longer. Specifically, this means that one should prefer to design features so that old content can take advantage
      of new features without having to make unrelated changes. And implementations should be able to add new features
      to existing code, rather than having to develop whole separate modes.</p>
    <p>Switching to XML syntax requires a global change, so continue supporting classic HTML syntax as well.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="2-utility">2. Utility</h2>

    <p>These principles call for a design that makes sure HTML can be used effectively for its many intended purposes.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="solve-real-problems">Solve Real Problems</h3>

    <p>Changes to the spec should solve actual real-world problems. Abstract architectures that don&apos;t address an
      existing need are less favored than pragmatic solutions to problems that web content faces today. And existing
      widespread problems should be solved, when possible.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="priority-of-constituencies">Priority of Constituencies</h3>

    <p>In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity. In
      other words costs or difficulties to the user should be given more weight than costs to authors; which in turn
      should be given more weight than costs to implementors; which should be given more weight than costs to authors of
      the spec itself, which should be given more weight than those proposing changes for theoretical reasons alone. Of
      course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="secure-by-design">Secure By Design</h3>

    <p>Ensure that features work with the security model of the web. Preferrably address security considerations
      directly in the specification.</p>
    <p>Communicating between documents from different sites is useful, but an unrestricted version could put user data
      at risk. Cross-document messaging is designed to allow this without violating security constraints.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="separation-of-concerns">Separation of Concerns</h3>

    <p>HTML should allow separation of content and presentation. For this reason, markup that expresses structure is
      usually preferred to purely presentational markup. However, structural markup is a means to an end such as media
      independence. Profound and detailed semantic encoding is not necessary if the end can be reached otherwise.
      Defining reasonable default presentation for different media may be sufficient. HTML strikes a balance between
      semantic expressiveness and practical usefulness. Names of elements and attributes in the markup may be pragmatic
      (for brevity, history, simplicity) rather than completely accurate.</p>
    <p>The <strong> <code class="language-javascript">article</code></strong> element defines an individual article, but not the details of how it is
      displayed. A journal article may be the only article on a page, formatted in multiple columns, while a blog post
      may share a page with multiple other articles and be presented in a box with a border.</p>
    <p>The <strong> <code class="language-javascript">b</code></strong> and <strong> <code class="language-javascript">i</code></strong> elements are widely used &#x2014; it is
      better to give them good default rendering for various media including aural than to try to ban them.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="dom-consistency">DOM Consistency</h3>

    <p>The two serializations should be designed in such a way that the DOM trees produced by the respective parsers
      appear as consistently as feasible to scripts and other program code operating on the document trees.
      Discrepancies can be allowed for compatibility with legacy implementations, but the differences should be
      minimized.</p>
    <p>Also, unless required for compatibility with legacy implementations and deployed content, gratuitous difference
      in syntactic appearance should be avoided as well.</p>
    <p>The HTML (<strong> <code class="language-javascript">text/html</code></strong>) parser puts elements in the
      <strong> <code class="language-javascript">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code></strong> namespace in the DOM for compatibility with the XML
      syntax of HTML&#xA0;5.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="3-interoperability">3. Interoperability</h2>

    <p>These principles exist to improve the chances of HTML implementations being truly interoperable.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="well-defined-behavior">Well-defined Behavior</h3>

    <p>Prefer to clearly define behavior that content authors could rely on, in preference to vague or
      implementation-defined behavior. This way, it is easier to author content that works in a variety of user agents.
      However, implementations should still be free to make improvements in areas such as user interface and quality of
      rendering.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="avoid-needless-complexity">Avoid Needless Complexity</h3>

    <p>Simple solutions are preferred to complex ones, when possible. Simpler features are easier for user agents to
      implement, more likely to be interoperable, and easier for authors to understand. But this should not be used as
      an excuse to avoid satisfying the other principles.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="handle-errors">Handle Errors</h3>

    <p>Error handling should be defined so that interoperable implementations can be achieved. Prefer graceful error
      recovery to hard failure, so that users are not exposed to authoring errors.</p>
    <h2 class="mume-header" id="4-universal-access">4. Universal Access</h2>

    <p>Features should be designed for universal access. This category covers various principles related to that.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="media-independence">Media Independence</h3>

    <p>Features should, when possible, work across different platforms, devices, and media. This should not be taken to
      mean that a feature should be omitted just because some media or platforms can&apos;t support it. For example,
      interactive features should not be omitted merely because they can not be represented in a printed document.</p>
    <p>The general reflowability of HTML text makes it more suitable to variable screen dimensions than a representation
      of exact glyph positions.</p>
    <p>A hyperlink can not be actuated in a printed document, but that is no reason to omit the
      <strong> <code class="language-javascript">a</code></strong> element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="support-world-languages">Support World Languages</h3>

    <p>Enable publication in all world languages. But this should not be taken as equalizing writing systems by
      prohibiting features that do not apply to all of them. Features for packing multiple translations of a document in
      a single file are out of scope.</p>
    <p>Supporting Unicode allows text in most of the world&apos;s languages, including mixing of text in different
      languages.</p>
    <p>Italic text is useful because it applies to many bicameral scripts, even though some scripts have no such
      concept. Similarly, ruby is useful for many scripts, even though it has a CJK focus.</p>
    <p>Text in element content has better language support than text in attribute content; in element content ruby
      annotations can be inserted, as well as <strong> <code class="language-javascript">dir</code></strong> attributes and
      <strong> <code class="language-javascript">bdo</code></strong> elements in case the Unicode bidirectional algorithm is insufficient to
      correctly order adjacent runs of mixed direction text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="mume-header" id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

    <p>Design features to be accessible to users with disabilities. Access by everyone regardless of ability is
      essential. This does not mean that features should be omitted entirely if not all users can make full use of them,
      but alternate mechanisms should be provided.</p>
    <p>The image in an <strong> <code class="language-javascript">img</code></strong> may not be visible to blind users, but that is a reason to
      provide alternate text, not to leave out images.</p>
    <p>The <strong> <code class="language-javascript">progress</code></strong> element is intrinsically accessible as it has unambiguous progress bar
      semantics which permits mapping to accessibility APIs that can represent progress indicators.</p>
